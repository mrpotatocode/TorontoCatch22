# TorontoCatch22

This was Part 1 of Experimental Design coursework and intended to be an introduction to tidyverse, ggplot, and using open data sets for data science. 

## Abstract

Explores the comparison in magnitude of Parking Tickets issued throughout Toronto and TTC Subway Delays across 24 hours for 2018. Data from TTC Subway Delays and Parking Tickets datasets from Open Toronto Data Portal were used. Both datasets were normalized to provide an accurate comparison. TTC Subway Delays and Parking Tickets were found to both peak at the beginning and end of the workday.
